      <h3 class="heading"><b> Your guide to trains, trams, busses and bikes </b></h3>

      <p class="section-content">
        Europe has one of the most advanced transportation systems in the world.
        From massive metropolises to small towns, you can easily link up from
        place to place by public transport. Riding the rails across this
        marvelous continent might be the best way to explore: it‚Äôs highly
        efficient, cost-effective, and darn romantic. There‚Äôs nothing like
        riding a train through snow-capped Austrian mountains or beside a
        still-blue lake.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading"><b> Long-distance transportation </b></h3>

      <p class="section-content">
        Most European countries have several types of long-distance trains. The
        fastest are the high-speed trains, like the TGV system in France. These
        trains travel at great speed and usually link up two big cities with
        very few‚Äîif any‚Äîstops along the way. For example, you can get from
        Krakow to Warsaw in about two and a half hours, one hour less than
        driving and far more sustainable to boot. After the high-speed trains,
        most countries have fast regional trains. For the sake of consistency,
        let‚Äôs stick to France, which has the TER train system. These trains go
        fast, but often stop a few times along the way and serve smaller towns
        and cities. Finally, you can find local trains that link up many small
        towns along a given route. Often, you might find you‚Äôll need to take a
        combination of two types of trains to get to your destination.
        <br /><br />
        In addition to the trains listed above, Europe is also home to
        long-distance international lines, which could take you from, say,
        Stockholm to Barcelona. These trains are often the most romantic. They
        offer sleeping compartments on night trains and dining cars with
        full-service meals. Finally, you have scenic routes, which privilege the
        views and experience over the speed. Here you‚Äôll have viewing cars with
        glass ceilings, luxurious dining cars, cocktail bars, and real beds.
        Want to make the journey truly part of the experience? These scenic
        routes are ideal for you. <br /><br />
        <b>
          Note: trains in Europe are typically very reasonably priced. Perhaps
          most important, though, they emit far less CO2 than airplanes, making
          them the ideal environmental choice. Also, make sure to check out
          multi-country rail passes that give you a single ticket for many train
          networks around Europe.

      <h3 class="heading"><b> Getting around in the city </b></h3>
      <p class="section-content">
        Most cities in Europe have an advanced public transport system. Almost
        invariably, it will consist of a mix of permutations, such as metro
        lines, tramways, and busses. Once again, public transport is almost
        certainly the best way to get around in Europe. Parking in most cities
        can be complicated and is almost always expensive, so ditching the car
        for a rechargeable metro card will serve you well. Another great option
        that most European cities offer is a public biking system. If not, bike
        rentals are super common and offer you the option to see the city as you
        travel through it (as opposed to being underground on the metro). Most
        cities are highly bike-friendly, with some privileging bikes to most
        other forms of transportation (just visit the Netherlands!). Bikes are
        also great in the countryside. You can explore entire regions on your
        two wheels! <br> <br>
        <b>
          Tip: before you visit a city or town, do some research about the
          public transport. Answer questions like what the hours of the system
          are and whether you can buy tickets on the bus or must board with a
          ticket. For bikes and scooters, check whether you need an app or card
          to access them.
        </b>
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading"><b> Water-travel: ferries and boats </b></h3>
      <p class="section-content">
        Sometimes, boats are best! Ferries are common in European cities and
        towns on the sea. Often, they connect the mainland with small islands
        off the coast, but they can also travel long distances like from Sweden
        to Poland. One great advantage of longer-distance ferries is that you
        can bring a car. Barges and cruise boats are also common on European
        rivers. Though they mainly serve as an experience rather than a form of
        transport, they are a great way to explore new territory in a peaceful
        and relaxing way. Hop off the boat to explore new towns, browse local
        markets, visit small shops, then hop back on the water and head to the
        next place. Here are a couple of good routes: take the ferries in
        Gothenburg to visit a dozen gorgeous islands off the coast; travel down
        the Rhein or the Danube to see gorgeous medieval villages and taste
        great wine along the way.
      </p>

      <h3 class="heading"><b>Accessibility </b></h3>
      <p class="section-content">
        European cities are always working to make their public infrastructure
        accessible to all. A great way to explore a city‚Äôs accessibility is to
        visit the list of places that have won an Access City Award. This award
        celebrates cities that ‚Äúguarantee equal access to fundamental rights,
        improve the quality of life of its population, and ensure that
        everybody, regardless of age, mobility or ability, has equal access to
        all the resources and pleasures cities have to offer.‚Äù For more about
        the Access City Award, click here. Some recent winners include: Bor√•s,
        Breda, Gothenburg, and J√∂nk√∂ping.

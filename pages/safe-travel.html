        <b class="section-tip"> 
          No matter what, safety while traveling is most important. Luckily,
          Europe has a stellar safety record, and more than a dozen of its
          countries regularly appear at the top end of safest places to live and
          travel lists. To make your adventure safe and secure, consider these
          tips and best practices!

      <h3 class="heading"><b> Travel insurance </b></h3>

      <p class="section-content">
        There are many forms of travel insurance, but most policies share one
        key component: they cover you in case something unexpected or
        unfortunate happens. This typically applies if you have unexpected
        medical expenses, lost luggage, stolen items, or delays or cancellations
        of travel plans. In many cases, travel insurance policies will even
        cover you in the case of a medivac, especially from remote places.
      </p>
      <p class="section-content">
        Your home country will surely have several travel insurance providers.
        The best way to move forward and choose the right policy for you is to
        compare options online, and then phone the providers if you still have
        questions. Remember to read the fine print! A good rule of thumb is that
        a travel insurance policy should cost about 5-12% of your trip’s cost,
        but rates will vary depending on where you are.
      </p>

      <p class="section-content">
        <b>
          Good to know: some insurers offer travel policies as part of bigger
          existing bundles. That means you might be surprised to learn that you
          already have travel insurance. The best thing to do is contact your
          company and inquire about what your policy covers.

        <b>Health tips</b>
      </h3>

      <p class="section-content">
        Every person is different, which means each of us will have slightly
        different health needs. The best thing to ensure your health while in
        Europe is to follow what works best for you in your everyday life. For
        example, does pollen in the spring make your nose run? You might run
        into the same thing in Europe, so plan accordingly.
        <br /><br />
        Generally speaking, there are no required vaccinations to visit Europe.
        That said, being up to date with common vaccines like the one for
        tetanus is always a good idea—better to do it at home with no stress and
        your current health insurance than have to do it in an emergency while
        abroad. Before leaving, have a discussion with your general
        practitioner. Ask him what he recommends, given your planned itinerary.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Important tip:</b> before leaving, it’s essential you contact your
        health insurance provider to enquire about what—if any—coverage they
        offer you while abroad. Though travel insurance often covers health
        emergencies, you might be presented with a health expense that falls
        under your regular insurance. Before leaving, be sure you know what they
        cover and bring your health insurance card or other paperwork with you.
        Last but not least, if you do need to seek medical help while in Europe,
        make sure you save all your receipts and results. These will be crucial
        for getting a refund when you’re back home. <br /><br />
        If you take any prescriptions, make sure you bring enough medicine
        (perhaps even a week’s supply extra, just in case) to last your trip.
        Though well-stocked pharmacies exist in every corner of Europe, getting
        any medicine that isn’t over the counter requires a prescription from a
        doctor who is licensed in that particular country. Also, keep in mind
        that even if you have a valid European prescription, you might pay a
        high price for medication, since you won’t have local health coverage.
        <br /><br />
        <b>Good to know:</b> pharmacies are usually indicated by an illuminated
        green cross above the shop. Most European cities have an abundance of
        pharmacies, and small villages typically have a local pharmacist. Need
        medicine in the middle of the night? Search online for 24-hour
        pharmacies. Most city districts will have one.
      </p>
      <b class="section-content">
        Tip: learn a few linguistic variations of the word pharmacy, such as Chemist, Pharmacie, Pharmacia, or Apotheek.
      </b>

      <h3 class="heading">
        <b>Emergency numbers  </b>
      </h3>
      <p class="section-content">
        Phoning emergency services in Europe is simple and effective. Dial the number 112 anywhere in Europe and you will be automatically connected to an English-speaking representative of the country from which you are calling. Once they know what help you require, they can connect you to the relevant local services.   
      </p>
      <b class="section-content">
        Tip: most European countries have their own dedicated emergency lines. To be extra safe, it’s a good idea to look up those numbers for each country you visit.
